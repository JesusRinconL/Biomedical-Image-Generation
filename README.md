# Synthesised-Biomedical-Image-Generation
## Introduction
Welcome to the Biomedical Image Generation repository. This repository contains the comprehensive codebase and requirements necessary for generating synthetic biomedical images with pix2pix. It provides detailed explanations for each component, covering the entire process from initial segmentation to the generation of reference images, and culminating in the final model training.

To optimize performance and reduce execution time, it is recommended to run this code on a GPU-enabled device. The codebase is highly adaptable, allowing for modifications to suit various requirements. In particular, the segmentation tool is designed to be customizable, ensuring specificity for different biomedical imaging scenarios.
